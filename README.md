# Ana-Zatarain-Repository

Welcome to Ana Zatarain's Repository!

Here, you will find a repository for the competitions I have been fortunate enough to be a part of throughout the last four years:

Grand Jamboree, iGEM's 2022 Global Competition, France. October 2022.

Map the System Competition, University of Oxford, UK. June 2022.

SOLV[ED] Youth Innovation Challenge, MIT, USA. March 2022.

Participating both individually or as a member of a student groups, these fast-paced experiences have shaped my research and inquisitory skills; they have also helped become more independent, organized, and self-motivated Furthermore, by immersing myself in the issues, allowing myself to become sensitized by them, and by interviewing those who come face-to-face with them on a daily basis, I have come to understand that my main goal in life is to use my skills to help my community and those without a voice.
